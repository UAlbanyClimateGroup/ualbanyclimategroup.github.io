Climate Group is an informal group of faculty, graduate students, and postdocs from 
DAES, ASRC, and across UAlbany with research interests in climate. Climate Group meetings
provide an opportunity for students, postdocs, and faculty to present and discuss their recent
or ongoing climate-related research and get feedback from the group.
